I spent too much time decided on and building the basic layout and scene management part of the project in Godot.

Now I have a main menu, game, pause menu scenes and a main scene controlling all of them, as well as a global script that I will later fill with data concerning the player's progression in the game or their current run.

I wanted to have everything organized well before I started so now I am really at a starting off point, even if I really didn't get much done at all.

Next, I want to get the game scene organized and basic version with walls and balls that bounce built out.

I am trying to do one of these blog posts a day, which means make some progress on the project once a day. Tomorrow is saturday, but I should still have time so hopefully this can get done by tomorrow. I wonder if anyone (other than me) will read this lol. I'm mostly doing this blog for self accountability purposes so probably not but whatever.
