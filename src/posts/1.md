A pool/billiards roguelite. That's the idea. All my game ideas recently are just "______ roguelite" lol, but I think this one can work.

Some games I want to use as inspiration: Balatro, Peglin, 8 ball pool.

I like how in Balatro, you start out playing normal poker hands and then by the end of the run, it's entirely different and there's all these triggers and synergies that the run is based on. I want to do something similar with this game, in that you start playing normal pool (by yourself), but by the end it visually looks way different and crazy stuff is happening.

I have some ideas for the game and roguelite elements to include, but I need more obviously.

I'm gonna create this game using Godot. 

Now I gotta get started on building a simple version of the game.
