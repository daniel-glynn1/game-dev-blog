Alright so, here's what I've done since the last blog update.

- improved physics a bit, better friction (physics still needs some work though)
- now game detects when balls go into a pocket
- refactored all code to use static typing
- made player able to rotate camera to "line up" shots, but i removed this as when it's top down, rotating doesn't really help in lining up shots, though i made add this back in later
- balls positioned in a triangle

Next, I want to start implementing basic roguelite elements like a shop phase and architectural stuff like that so I can get started on that side of things

Lots to do.
