title: Balls are moving and some assets

I'm deciding to do pixel art for this game for now. All assets will be created by me using Aseprite which I just bought. I'm hoping I can iteratively improve on the art as I work on the game, and eventually it will look decent.

If it ends up not looking good, then I'll figure something out then. We'll go under that bridge when we get to it (we're on a boat).

I had already started work on the ball design, here's what that looks like:

This weekend, I got a first version of the cue and table (using a tileset for the table to allow for modularity which is gonna be useful when building out roguelite elements) done as well. These are placeholders for now:

![Table 0](/images/table0.png)

Finally, here's a video of the game with balls moving around, the "cue ball" being controlled by mouse swipes. I'm only including this video as a before picture of sorts to show the progress of the game as it's developed, even if it doesn't really make sense to include this as the first version of the game. Right the table tiles are 32x32 pixels but I probably want to increase that to 64x64 (as well as add some design to them obviously).
