So I realized the table tileset tiles need to be 64x64 pixels as 32x32 did not look good. I spent a bit up time working on that, and found that 4 times the pixels allows for a lot more room for art design, not that I was really trying to add special design on the first table, but still. It's pretty cool what you can do with a little bit of color and shading, I should learn more about color theory.

I'm still gonna iterate on this table design, but it looks a lot better, here is the tileset:

I also made an upscaled cue sprite, which looks more like a normal cue lol.

Lastly, I spent some time making the cue ball actually move in a sensible way. You strike the cue ball by clicking and holding down the mouse and then releasing when you want to hit. I'm just drawing the cue at the mouse position, with a min and max distance from the cue ball, as well as some geometry to point it towards the cue ball. It was kinda hard figuring out how to get the mouse click and drag to work how you would expect it would, but after some geometry stuff, it works pretty well. Here is what the game looks like now.

Next, I want to work on the physics a bit more and get the balls moving around faster but also stopping sooner, overall just making it more satisfying. I'm also going to get the pockets working, by creating area2ds (in code probably) and checking when a ball enters them. From there, the logic for a classic pool game should follow pretty easily. I also got to make sure no balls are moving before you can strike the cue ball, rather than just checking if the cue ball is still.
